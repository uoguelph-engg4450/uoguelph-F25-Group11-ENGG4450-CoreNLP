# ENGG*4450 â€“ Large-Scale Software Architecture Engineering  
## Phase 2: Implementing Change Requests  
**Group 11 â€“ Stanford CoreNLP Project**

---

### Overview
This repository contains the implementation and verification for **ENGG*4450 Phase 2**, focused on extending and testing the **Stanford CoreNLP** natural language processing (NLP) library.

Two issues from the CoreNLP issue tracker were selected and implemented:

1. **Issue #1394 â€“ HTML Interface Not Reflecting Quote Annotator**  
   Verified that the Quote Annotator executed correctly through the HTTP API, successfully returning JSON output though not displayed in the HTML UI.

2. **Issue #1459 â€“ Add Dockerfile for CoreNLP**  
   Implemented a working Dockerfile for containerized CoreNLP deployment, enabling consistent setup, testing, and reproducible execution across environments.

### ðŸ“‚ Repository Contents
| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `CoreNLPDemo.java` | Custom demo class that initializes the CoreNLP pipeline, annotates text, and writes results to a timestamped output file. |
| `CoreNLP.properties` | Configuration file specifying annotators (tokenize, ssplit, pos, lemma, ner, parse, depparse, coref, quote, sentiment). |
| `Dockerfile` | Container configuration to run the CoreNLP server in Docker. |
| `output.json` | Example JSON output from a cURL test request. |
| `results/analysis_output_20251016_221530.txt` | Sample text analysis result generated by the Java demo. |
| `results/analysis_output_20251018_154851.txt` | Additional sample run output. |
| `.gitignore` | Excludes build artifacts, images, and temporary files. |
| `README.md` | This documentation file. |

### How to Run Locally (Java)

#### 1. Prerequisites
- Install **Java JDK 17** or later.  
- Download or verify that the **stanford-corenlp-4.5.10** library folder exists in the same directory as this repository.  
- Ensure that your terminalâ€™s working directory is the root of the cloned project.

#### 2. Compile the Java Program
```bash
javac -cp "stanford-corenlp-4.5.10/*" CoreNLPDemo.java
```

#### 3. Run the Program
```bash
java -cp ".:stanford-corenlp-4.5.10/*" CoreNLPDemo
```

#### 4. Expected Output
- A folder named `/results/` will be created automatically.  
- A timestamped `.txt` file will appear inside `results/`, containing:
  - Sentence segmentation  
  - POS tags and dependency trees  
  - Named entities  
  - Sentiment results  

Example console output:
```bash
[INFO] Created output directory: /results
[SUCCESS] Results written to: results/analysis_output_20251016_221530.txt
```

### Testing via cURL API (Quote Annotator)

Run the following command to validate **Issue #1394** (Quote Annotator functionality):

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -F "input=John said, 'I am learning CoreNLP.'" \
  "http://localhost:9000/?properties=%7B%22annotators%22%3A%22tokenize,ssplit,pos,lemma,ner,parse,depparse,coref,quote%22%2C%22coref.algorithm%22%3A%22neural%22%2C%22outputFormat%22%3A%22json%22%7D" \
  > output.json
```

Expected output snippet:
```json
"quotes": [
  {
    "quoteText": "I am learning CoreNLP.",
    "speaker": "John"
  }
]
```

---

### Run in Docker (Containerized Environment)

#### 1. Build Docker Image
```bash
docker build -t corenlp:4.5.10 .
```

#### 2. Run the Container
```bash
docker run -p 9000:9000 --name corenlp-server corenlp:4.5.10
```

#### 3. Verify Server Access
Visit [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000) in your web browser to confirm the CoreNLP web interface is running.

### Verification Steps for TA

| Step | Action | Expected Result |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| 1 | Clone the repository | Folder `F25-Group11-CoreNLP` appears locally |
| 2 | Open and compile `CoreNLPDemo.java` | No compilation errors |
| 3 | Run program | Output file generated in `/results` |
| 4 | Inspect output file | Contains sentences, POS, NER, and sentiment |
| 5 | Run Docker container | CoreNLP server starts at port 9000 |
| 6 | Execute cURL test | JSON file confirms quote + speaker data |
| 7 | Review README.md | Contains complete setup and testing guide |
